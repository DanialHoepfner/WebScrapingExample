This repository contains an example of webscraping from a register of the United Nations NGO branch of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The website for the full register is at the following url: http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/login.do 
It was developed in Spyder using python 2.7 and was last run successfully 2/29/2016. 
The .py file can be run from the start to gather and clean the data, at the end it shows a couple of simple descriptive statistics. 
Doing so requires none of the other files, however, step 1 in program can be skipped to just demonstrate the cleaning using fullset. 
Similarly steps 1 and 2 can be skipped and just display the sample statistics using the fullsetclean file. 
The files named arrayX are aggregated in step 1 to make the fullset data.
